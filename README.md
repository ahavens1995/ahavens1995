Hi there!

I am a Systems Engineer with four years of software development experience, three years managing a testing group, and two years of system requirements development experience.

Over the last six years, I have worked closely with software, hardware, and system requirements to develop, test, and present finished products to customers. I led quality assurance operations to verify product requirements and present customers with training on how to use our products.

During my time at Raytheon, I led quality assurance operations which included defining testing scope and management plan, executing testing actions, and communicating testing results to upper leadership. I greatly enjoyed managing the team and the challenges that came with a test environment constantly changing. It pushed me to work collaboratively with my team and ensure the appropriate features were prioritized in testing.

In my work, I strive to ensure a high level of transparency and knowledge sharing. At L3Harris, I have worked with the Jira Support team to connect them with Systems Engineers struggling to use Jira. I enjoyed this challenge as it gave me the chance to create transparent training on how to properly use Jira to suit Systems Engineers needs and a connection to the Jira Support Team.   

I have always enjoyed working alongside people in many different roles, as I find leveraging connections important to completing tasks on time. I believe everyone has value on a team and actively utilizing everyone ensures a smoother path forward to finishing a project.
Producing a desired product requires working closely with customers to ensure their needs are being met. I have found it incredibly rewarding to act as an intermediary between developers and customers. I enjoy being able to pull new ideas from customers and work with engineers to tailor them to produce an enhanced product.
