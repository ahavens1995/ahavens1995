Hi there!

My name is Aurora Havens. After graduation from Southern Methodist University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, I have spent the last four years as a software engineer
at Raytheon. 

During my time at Raytheon, I have worked on the software for the MTS Bravo and MTS Delta variant, developed automated common tests to reduce our testing timeline by ~40%, 
coodinated software release testing efforts with my team, and, more recently, written requirements for our software.

While I have enjoyed my time at Raytheon, I thought this position looked really interesting and I wanted to bring my software and management skills to the table for this position.
